This photograph captures a pivotal element of the Fluid and Thermal Systems Laboratory at the [Department of Mechanical Engineering](https://nmt.edu/academics/mtls/index.php) at the New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology during the fall of 2020. 
The image shows the wind tunnel, and the data processing station. I served as a teaching assistant in this course, contributing to the experiential learning environment showcased in the scene.
