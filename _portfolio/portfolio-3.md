In the Fall of 2022, these images were captured at the Steve W. Chaddick School of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the Georgia Institute of Technology. They document moments both preceding and during laboratory sessions on distinct occasions. In those solitary frames, I am depicted engrossed in preparing the laboratory environment before the students join for their scheduled sessions. Contrastingly, the frames where I am accompanied by students capture the successful resolution of circuit troubleshooting and the attainment of accurate waveforms.

These shared experiences are palpably reflected in the joyful expressions of the students, vividly portrayed in the photographs. The collective atmosphere conveys not only the technical achievements but also the satisfaction and enthusiasm shared by all participants in these educational endeavors.
