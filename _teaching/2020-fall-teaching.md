I served as a teaching assistant in this lab and the following topics were covered:
*This lab explores the basics of thermal conduction through the use of finned plates in a small
wind tunnel.
*Basic heat conduction and thermal radiation and also provides an introduction and in-depth analysis of
boundary layers. The use of flow visualization techniques and particle image velocimetry (PIV)

*Familiarity with basic wind tunnel operation and simple pitot-static measurements. This lab includes two distinct experiments: drag on three-dimensional models and pressure
distribution over a 2D wing.
