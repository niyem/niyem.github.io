This lab explores the basics of thermal conduction through the use of finned plates in a small wind tunnel; basic heat conduction and thermal radiation and also provides an introduction and in-depth analysis of boundary layers. The use of flow visualization techniques and particle image velocimetry (PIV). Familiarity with basic wind tunnel operation and simple pitot-static measurements. This lab includes two distinct experiments: drag on three-dimensional models and pressure distribution over a 2D wing.
