During my tenure as a high school physics and chemistry teacher, I meticulously designed and delivered engaging courses across all levels. In addition to designing and instructing physics and chemistry classes, I assumed the role of overseeing laboratory activities, particularly in schools fortunate enough to have equipped laboratories.

Over the span of six years, I had the privilege of imparting knowledge to approximately 3000 students. Furthermore, I took on the responsibility of mentoring assistant teachers in the domains of physics and chemistry, contributing to their growth and development.
