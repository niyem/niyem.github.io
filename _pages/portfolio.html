    </div>

    <p>Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymers (CFRP) stand out in various industries for their exceptional properties, particularly in aerospace, where their lightweight nature translates to significant energy savings. Despite these advantages, the Non-Destructive Evaluation (NDE) of CFRP poses significant challenges. In response, this research focuses on developing advanced AI algorithms to enhance the analysis of terahertz NDE data, aiming for more effective characterization.</p>

    <p>The primary objective is to address the complexities associated with CFRP NDE, contributing to the successful completion of the project. The positive impact of this research extends to industries such as aerospace, transportation, energy, and manufacturing.</p>

    </div>

    <p>Leading a collaborative effort with two fellow PhD students—one at the Georgia Institute of Technology in the USA and the other at Université du Québec à Trois-Rivières, Canada—I am spearheading the development of a Smart Hybrid Washing System (SEHWS). This innovative project involves designing and simulating an optimized SEHWS that draws power from both the national grid and a wind generator. Our objective is to minimize reliance on grid energy, especially during energy-intensive washing processes, addressing environmental and sustainability concerns.</p>

    <h1>3. Assessment Plan</h1>

    <p>SWHs consist of solar collectors that absorb sunlight and transfer the heat to a fluid, which then circulates through a system to heat water. Solar water heaters are vital for rural areas for several reasons. Primarily, they provide a sustainable and cost-effective alternative to traditional energy sources, reducing reliance on electricity or fossil fuels. Additionally, solar water heaters require minimal maintenance and have a long lifespan, making them suitable for rural environments with limited resources for repairs. I got interested into these sustainable devices during an exchange program at <a href="https://sterg.sun.ac.za/">STERG</a> due to the above advantages. I delved into the modeling and simulation of these devices and upon my return to Togo, I pursued my dream on assessing the potential of SWHs in Togo, which led to a published article that can be downloaded <a href="https://www.semanticscholar.org/reader/e57b7cd246cd351644cf4572eb6f0b9643abe59c">here</a>.</p>
