    <h1>1. Course Description</h1>
    <p>  In this course, you will explore cutting-edge nondestructive evaluation (NDE) methods used across industries from aerospace and construction to healthcare and energy. The course will help you discover how the hidden flaws and weaknesses in materials and structures are revealed without causing damage, and unlock the techniques that keep the world safe. Students will learn how to detect cracks, corrosion, and other defects using advanced technologies like ultrasound, X-rays, and terahertz radiation. This course goes beyond technical skills by allowing you to develop critical thinking, problem-solving, and analytical abilities essential to the modern engineer or scientist. The knowledge you gain here is indispensable, helping you ensure safety and reliability in systems that shape our society infrastructures such as bridges, airplanes, pipelines, and more. Youâ€™ll walk away not just with the ability to test materials and infrastructures but with the mindset of a detective, someone who can foresee and prevent disasters. Whether you aim to advance in engineering, science, or a related field, this course equips you with skills that transcend the classroom, impacting real-world applications where failure is not an option.</p>
