This work aims to investigate the optimum energy usage of migratory birds balancing from large flock to small flocks By investigating the flight formation and dislocation of flocks. We describe the advantages associated with migratory birds. The results show that the drag reduction for flock formation increases with the flock size. These advantages can also be implemented by drones while used for the mission like camouflage. The most important benefit of flock formation and disintegration is the least energy consumption of birds during their travel.
