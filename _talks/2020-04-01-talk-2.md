This research investigates the performance improvement of migratory birds through flock mutation. A constant number of migratory birds mutate from a big flock to small flocks and vice versa. Potential energy saving has been investigated through the entire flight time. In the present study, a drag analysis is carried out on the flocks and its sensitivity to different parameters is investigated.
